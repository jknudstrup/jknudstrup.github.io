Hello and welcome to our short introductory course on EEG-based interfaces! You're going to learn the basic concepts that explain how we can use this technology to control things with our brains. EEG (electroencephalography) has been around for a very long time, but most people outside of a medical or research setting have never had access to it. However, very recently the tech has gotten cheap and reliable enough that regular people can play around with it and pull off some very interesting stuff. Observe:
* Example one
* Example two
* As many examples as seem reasonable

Cool, right? You might be wondering now, how hard is it to learn this stuff? The answer is: not necessarily hard at all. It's true that we are going to engage with ideas that come from neuroscience, psychology, physics, data analysis, and more, but it's not necessary to have a background in any of these things. In fact, very few people come into this stuff knowing about all of the relevant fields. In this course, we are going to pick out the relevant parts from these disciplines, and explain them as simply as possible. So if you are a raw beginner, or if you've already got experience in one field (electronics, psychology, etc.) and want to fill in some holes in your understanding of the other parts, you've come to the right place.

In the Chapter 1, we'll explain the relationship of the mind and brain, and how brain activity creates electric signals that we can measure. In Chapter 2, we'll talk about that signal, what it looks like, and how we can tease it apart to get finer details about what's happening in the brain. In Chapter 3, we'll talk about getting the signal into your computer, and using machine learning tools to find patterns within it. Finally, in Chapter 4, we show you some ways that you can map those patterns to inputs within a program. At the very end, we'll wrap things up with a conclusion, to encapsulate the things you've learned and talk about where to go next.

We hope you enjoy this journey as much as we have!
